# Spell-Check-Project---Natural-Language-Processing
A project that trains a language model to build a spell checker. Using Dan Jurafsky and Chris Manning's online NLP course assignment, the Laplace Unigram Language Model is implemented with add-one smoothing. Sentences with one misspelled word each are tested and the noisy-channel model is used for spelling correction.
